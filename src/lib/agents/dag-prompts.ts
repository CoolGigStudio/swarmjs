Create a DAG as a JSON array. Each task should have:
- id: String identifier for the task
- type: Either "function" for direct function calls or "subdag" for nested DAGs
- functionName: (for function type) Name of the function to call
- functionArgs: (for function type) Object with function arguments
- subdag: (for subdag type) Object containing:
  - goal: The specific goal for this sub-DAG
  - requiredFunctions: Array of function names needed for this sub-DAG
  - isComplexTask: true
- dependencies: Array of task IDs this task depends on

Important:
1. DO NOT execute functions directly. Your role is to create the DAG structure only.
2. For complex tasks requiring multiple steps, create a sub-DAG and specify which functions it needs.
3. Only include functions in requiredFunctions that are necessary for that specific sub-task.
4. Use "$taskId" syntax to reference results from previous tasks.

Example:
[
  {
    "id": "getData",
    "type": "function",
    "functionName": "fetch_data",
    "functionArgs": {
      "source": "database"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "processData",
    "type": "subdag",
    "subdag": {
      "goal": "Process and analyze the fetched data",
      "requiredFunctions": ["clean_data", "analyze_data"],
      "isComplexTask": true
    },
    "dependencies": ["getData"]
  }
]

After creating the DAG, call the executeDagFunction function to execute it.`;

export const SUB_DAG_CREATION_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are a helpful assistant responsible for creating a sub-DAG plan.
Your goal is: {goal}

You have been provided with a focused set of functions specifically chosen for this sub-task:
{functionList}

Function descriptions:
{functionDescriptions}

Create a DAG following the same format as the main DAG. You can access parent DAG results using "$parent.taskId".

Example sub-DAG:
[
  {
    "id": "clean",
    "type": "function",
    "functionName": "clean_data",
    "functionArgs": {
      "data": "$parent.getData"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "analyze",
    "type": "function",
    "functionName": "analyze_data",
    "functionArgs": {
      "cleanedData": "$clean"
    },
    "dependencies": ["clean"]
  }
]`;

export const DAG_EXECUTION_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are a skilled assistant executing a DAG plan.

Current DAG structure:
{dagStructure}

For each task:
1. Check if all dependencies are met
2. If task type is "function":
   - Execute the function with its arguments
   - Store the result for use in dependent tasks
3. If task type is "subdag":
   - A new creation agent will be spawned with the specified required functions
   - The sub-DAG will be created and executed
   - Results will be stored for dependent tasks

Your role is to:
- Execute tasks in the correct order based on dependencies
- Properly handle function results and pass them to dependent tasks
- DO NOT modify the DAG structure or create new tasks

* If user provides a parameter value which is different from the value in the DAG, use the user-provided value.

export const META_DAG_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are executing a meta-DAG that controls the creation and execution of task DAGs.

The meta-DAG has two phases:
1. DAG Creation:
   - Define the DAG structure for achieving the goal
   - Identify complex tasks that need sub-DAGs
   - Specify required functions for each sub-DAG

2. DAG Execution:
   - Execute tasks in dependency order
   - Create and execute sub-DAGs with focused function sets
   - Track and propagate results

Your goal is: {goal}

Follow the DAG structure and ensure proper phase transitions.`;
